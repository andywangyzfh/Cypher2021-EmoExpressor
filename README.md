# Cypher 2021 - EmoExpresser

An emoji recommender based on the real-time emotion detection.
###What it does?  
-Capture your face, analyze your emotion and recommend some emotes that suits your mood.  
###Inspiration  
-People often don't know how to express their emotion. AI can decide it for you.  
-College students face a lot of pressure. So why not have some fun with an AI?  
###Challenges we face  
-We are all new to deep learning. It took us effort to understand (partially) the theory behind emote recognition.  
-We are also new to front end developing. We spent lots of time making the UI responds to outputs of the deep learning model.  
###What we learned?  
-Implementation of CNN in python(not the whole theory, but how to use it)  
-Using OpenCV package to implement emote recognition  
-Developing web front end for a python program  
-How to assign programming works to several team members  


**Requirement:** Python3, OpenCV3, Keras, Tensorflow
