# Cypher 2021 - EmoExpresser

An emoji recommender based on the real-time emotion detection.
What it does?
-Capture your face, analyze your emotion and recommend some emotes that suits your mood.
Inspiration
-People often don't know how to express their emotion. AI can decide it for you.
-College students face a lot of pressure. So why not have some fun with an AI?
Challenges we face
-We are all new to deep learning. It took us effort to understand (partially) the theory behind emote recognition.
-We are also new to front end developing. We spent lots of time making the UI responds to outputs of the deep learning model.
What we learned?
-Implementation of CNN in python(not the theory, but how to use it)
-Using OpenCV package to implement emote recognition
-Developing web front end for a python program
-How to assign programming works to several team members


**Requirement:** Python3, OpenCV3, Keras, Tensorflow
